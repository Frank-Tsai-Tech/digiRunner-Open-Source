## Overview
digiRunner is an application-layer API gateway that acts as a central hub for communication between clients and your backend services in a microservices architecture. It simplifies frontend development by providing a unified API endpoint, streamlining interactions with your distributed backend services.

## Key Features:

- Intelligent Routing: Routes API requests efficiently to the appropriate backend service based on request content.
- Robust Security: Provides multi-layered authentication and authorization to protect your APIs from attacks.
- Real-time Monitoring: Monitors API performance with detailed data for proactive issue identification and resolution.
- Traffic Management: Ensures system stability by setting limits on API access frequency and quotas.

## Benefits of digiRunner:

- Simplified Frontend Development: Provides a single API entry point, reducing development complexity.
- Enhanced System Stability: Ensures reliability through traffic control and error handling.
- Improved System Security: Offers multiple security mechanisms to safeguard your system.
- Facilitated Microservices Governance: Enables unified management and control of your microservices through API management.

## Common Use Cases:

- Consolidate multiple backend services into a single, easily accessible API.
- Implement robust access control to protect your APIs from unauthorized access.
- Gain insights into API usage patterns through detailed monitoring data.
- Enforce rate limiting to prevent API overload and ensure system stability.
- Transform API outputs into various formats like JSON or XML for broader client compatibility.

## Quick Start

### 1. Using Container

choose one of the following options to launch service by container

#### Option 1: Docker

```shell
docker run -it -d -p 31080:18080 tpisoftwareopensource/digirunner-open-source
```

#### Option 2: Docker-Compose

```yml
name: digirunner-open-source
services:
    dgr:
        image: tpisoftwareopensource/digirunner-open-source
        ports:
            - "31080:18080"
        environment:
            - TZ=Asia/Taipei
```

- save above configuration to `opendgr-compose.yml`
- run `docker-compose -f opendgr-compose.yml up -d` at the same directory with `opendgr-compose.yml`

#### Option 3: Kubernetes

```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: digirunner-open-source-ns

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: digirunner-open-source-svc
  namespace: digirunner-open-source-ns
spec:
  ports:
    - name: tcp
      nodePort: 31080
      port: 18080
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: 18080
  selector:
    app: digirunner
  sessionAffinity: None
  type: NodePort

---

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: digirunner
  name: digirunner-open-source-deploy
  namespace: digirunner-open-source-ns
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: digirunner
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: digirunner
      namespace: digirunner-open-source-ns
    spec:
      containers:
        - env:
            - name: TZ
              value: Asia/Taipei
          image: tpisoftwareopensource/digirunner-open-source
          imagePullPolicy: Always
          name: digirunner
          ports:
            - containerPort: 18080
              name: tcp
              protocol: TCP
          workingDir: /opt/digirunner
```

- save above configuration to `digirunner-open-source.yml`
- run `kubectl apply -f digirunner-open-source.yml`

#### Connect to service

- Open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:31080/dgrv4/login
- Use the default credentials to login: 
  - username: `manager`
  - password: `manager123`

### 2. Run Your Own Build

### Pre-requisites

- OpenJDK 17+

---

1. Clone the repository: 
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/TPIsoftwareOSPO/digiRunner-Open-Source.git
    ```
2. Change directory:
    ```shell
    cd digiRunner-Open-Source/
    ```
3. Run the service:
    ```sh
    ./gradlew :dgrv4_Gateway_serv:bootRun
    ```

4. Wait for the digiRunner banner to appear.

4. Run the JAR:
    ```sh
    java -jar dgrv4_Gateway_serv/build/libs/digiRunner-{version}.jar --digiRunner.token.key-store.path=$PWD/dgrv4_Gateway_serv/keys
    ```

## Run digiRunner in a Local Container Registry
